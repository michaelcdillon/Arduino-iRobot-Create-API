Project Overview
================
The goal is to provide an easy to use api for interacting with the iRobot Create. This api
is designed to be able to be used with arduino libraries currently, however the serial calls
are abstracted away so anyone can use their own serial library on their own microcontroller
as long as they modify the correct functions.

ToDo
===
- Support sensor streaming.
- Support reading sensor groups.

Version 0.1
===========
- Full input, output, and drive commands through the Create robot.
- Read all sensor outputs from the robot, one at a time or user created lists of sensors.
- Simple control of the robot in a loop that drives until an obstical is hit and then 
  attempts to drive around it by using its bump sensors.
